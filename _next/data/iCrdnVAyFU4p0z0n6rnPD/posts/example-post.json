Nowadays, category theory is used in almost all areas of mathematics, and in some areas of computer science. In particular, many constructions of new mathematical objects from previous ones, that appear similarly in several contexts are conveniently expressed and unified in terms of categories. Examples include quotient spaces, direct products, completion, and duality.\r\n\r\nA category is formed by two sorts of objects, the objects of the category, and the morphisms, which relate two objects called the source and the target of the morphism. One often says that a morphism is an arrow that maps its source to its target. Morphisms can be composed if the target of the first morphism equals the source of the second one, and morphism composition has similar properties as function composition (associativity and existence of identity morphisms). Morphisms are often some sort of function, but this is not always the case. For example, a monoid may be viewed as a category with a single object, whose morphisms are the elements of the monoid.\r\n\r\nThe second fundamental concept of category is the concept of a functor, which plays the role of a morphism between two categories {\\displaystyle C_{1}}C_{1} and {\\displaystyle C_{2}:}{\\displaystyle C_{2}:} it maps objects of {\\displaystyle C_{1}}C_{1} to objects of {\\displaystyle C_{2}}C_{2} and morphisms of {\\displaystyle C_{1}}C_{1} to morphisms of {\\displaystyle C_{2}}C_{2} in such a way that sources are mapped to sources and targets are mapped to targets (or, in the case of a contravariant functor, sources are mapped to targets and vice-versa). A third fundamental concept is a natural transformation that may be viewed as a morphism of functors.\r\n\r\n$x^2+x+1$ \r\n\r\n$f(x)=2$"},"__N_SSG":true}
